# Bravo UI (Deprecated)
This project was a stepping stone in separating the UI of BRAVO into a self contained Vue based application.
The state that prompted this separation was having to run two flask apps on the server: one for the API and one for the UI.
The desired state was to run the flask app API and use a javascript UI that could be served as static files.

## Superceded by
The Bravo Vue project is the repository of the subsequent UI of BRAVO: https://github.com/statgen/bravo_vu
The Bravo API project is the repository of the server side API of BRAVO: https://github.com/statgen/bravo_api
